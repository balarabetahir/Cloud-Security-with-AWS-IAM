# Cloud-Security-with-AWS-IAM
IAM to control access to our AWS resources.

üîç In this project, I learned how to:

‚úÖ Launch and Manage Amazon EC2 Instances

I successfully launched and managed Amazon EC2 instances, leveraging scalable computing power to meet diverse workload demands.

‚úÖ Master AWS IAM for Robust Security

I explored AWS IAM in depth, ensuring secure and precise access controls through Policies, Users, and User Groups. This hands-on experience solidified my understanding of how to safeguard AWS environments effectively.

‚úÖ Test and Validate Security Settings

To ensure the efficacy of my configurations, I tested my IAM settings by logging into my AWS account as a new user. This practical approach confirmed the robustness of my security measures.

üåü Project Highlights:

The highlight of this project was discovering practical use cases for AWS IAM. For instance, automating permissions for new joiners in an organization streamlines the onboarding process while maintaining security. Additionally, using an Account Alias to customize the sign-in URL enhances user experience and branding.

This project not only honed my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into the critical role of IAM in cloud security. I‚Äôm excited to apply these learnings to future projects and contribute to creating secure cloud environments.
